You can load sounds at\nany time during the game by using the `sounds.load` method. You don't have to use\nthe `sounds` object or its `load` method, but it's a really convenient way to\nwork with sound file assets.\n\nHere's how could use the `sound` object to load three sound files from a `sounds` folder and\ncall a `setup` method when all the files have finished loading:\n\n    sounds.load([\n      \"sounds/shoot.wav\",\n      \"sounds/music.wav\",\n      \"sounds/bounce.mp3\"\n    ]);\n    sounds.whenLoaded = setup;\n\nYou can now access these loaded sounds in your application code like this:\n\nvar shoot = sounds[\"sounds/shoot.wav\"],\n    music = sounds[\"sounds/music.wav\"],\n    bounce = sounds[\"sounds/bounce.mp3\"];\n\n*/\n\nconst sounds = {\n  // Properties to help track the assets being loaded.\n  toLoad: 0,\n  loaded: 0,\n\n  // File extensions for different types of sounds.\n  audioExtensions: ['mp3', 'ogg', 'wav', 'webm'],\n\n  // The callback function that should run when all assets have loaded.\n  // Assign this when you load the fonts, like this: `assets.whenLoaded = makeSprites;`.\n  whenLoaded: undefined,\n\n  // The callback function to run after each asset is loaded\n  onProgress: undefined,\n\n  // The callback function to run if an asset fails to load or decode\n  onFailed (source, error) {\n    throw new Error(`Audio could not be loaded: ${source}`);\n  },\n\n  // The load method creates and loads all the assets.

You would only want to set it to `false` like this if you were\nusing another file loading library to load the sound, and didn't want it to be loaded\ntwice.\n\n`xhrObject`, the optional 4th argument, is the XHR object that was used to load the sound. Again, you\nwould only supply this if you were using another file loading library to load the sound,\nand that library had generated its own XHR object. If you supply the `xhr` argument, `makeSound`\nwill skip the file loading step (because you've already done that), but still decode the audio buffer for you.\n(If you are loading the sound file using another file loading library, make sure that your sound\nfiles are loaded with the XHR `responseType = \"arraybuffer\"` option.)\n\nFor example, here's how you could use this advanced configuration to decode a sound that you've already loaded\nusing your own custom loading system:\n\n   var soundSprite = makeSound(source, decodeHandler.bind(this), false, xhr);\n\nWhen the file has finished being decoded, your custom `decodeHandler` will run, which tells you\nthat the file has finished decoding.\n\nIf you're creating more than one sound like this, use counter variables to track the number of sounds\nyou need to decode, and the number of sounds that have been decoded. When both sets of counters are the\nsame, you'll know that all your sound files have finished decoding and you can proceed with the rest\nof you application. (The [Hexi game engine](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi) uses `makeSound` in this way.)\n\n*/\n\nfunction makeSound (source, loadHandler, shouldLoadSound, xhr, failHandler) {\n  // The sound object that this function returns.\n  const o = {};\n\n  // Set the default properties.\n  o.volumeNode = actx.createGain();\n\n  // Create the pan node using the efficient `createStereoPanner`\n  // method, if it's available.\n  if (!actx.createStereoPanner) {\n    o.panNode = actx.createPanner();\n  } else {\n    o.panNode = actx.createStereoPanner();\n  }\n\n  o.delayNode = actx.createDelay();\n  o.feedbackNode = actx.createGain();\n  o.filterNode = actx.createBiquadFilter();\n  o.convolverNode = actx.createConvolver();\n  o.soundNode = null;\n  o.buffer = null;\n  o.source = source;\n  o.loop = false;\n  o.playing = false;\n\n  // The function that should run when the sound is loaded.\n  o.loadHandler = undefined;\n\n  // Values for the `pan` and `volume` getters/setters.\n  o.panValue = 0;\n  o.volumeValue = 1;\n\n  // Values to help track and set the start and pause times.\n  o.startTime = 0;\n  o.startOffset = 0;\n\n  // Set the playback rate.\n  o.playbackRate = 1;\n\n  // Echo properties.\n  o.echo = false;\n  o.delayValue = 0.3;\n  o.feebackValue = 0.3;\n  o.filterValue = 0;\n\n  // Reverb properties\n  o.reverb = false;\n  o.reverbImpulse = null;\n\n  // The sound object's methods.\n  o.play = function () {\n    // Set the start time (it will be `0` when the sound\n    // first starts.\n    o.startTime = actx.currentTime;\n\n    // Create a sound node.\n    o.soundNode = actx.createBufferSource();\n\n    // Set the sound node's buffer property to the loaded sound.\n    o.soundNode.buffer = o.buffer;\n\n    // Set the playback rate\n    o.soundNode.playbackRate.value = this.playbackRate;\n\n    // Connect the sound to the pan, connect the pan to the\n    // volume, and connect the volume to the destination.\n    o.soundNode.connect(o.volumeNode);\n\n    // If there's no reverb, bypass the convolverNode\n    if (o.reverb === false) {\n      o.volumeNode.connect(o.panNode);\n    }\n\n    // If there is reverb, connect the `convolverNode` and apply\n    // the impulse response\n    else {\n      o.volumeNode.connect(o.convolverNode);\n      o.convolverNode.connect(o.panNode);\n      o.convolverNode.buffer = o.reverbImpulse;\n    }\n\n    // Connect the `panNode` to the destination to complete the chain.\n    o.panNode.connect(actx.destination);\n\n    // Add optional echo.\n    if (o.echo) {\n      // Set the values.\n      o.feedbackNode.gain.value = o.feebackValue;\n      o.delayNode.delayTime.value = o.delayValue;\n      o.filterNode.frequency.value = o.filterValue;\n\n      // Create the delay loop, with optional filtering.\n      o.delayNode.connect(o.feedbackNode);\n\n      if (o.filterValue > 0) {\n        o.feedbackNode.connect(o.filterNode);\n        o.filterNode.connect(o.delayNode);\n      } else {\n        o.feedbackNode.connect(o.delayNode);\n      }\n\n      // Capture the sound from the main node chain, send it to the\n      // delay loop, and send the final echo effect to the `panNode` which\n      // will then route it to the destination.\n      o.volumeNode.connect(o.delayNode);\n      o.delayNode.connect(o.panNode);\n    }\n\n    // Will the sound loop?
